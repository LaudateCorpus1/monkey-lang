Monkey programming language interpreter designed in [_Writing An Interpreter In Go_](https://interpreterbook.com/).
A step-by-step walk-through where each commit is a fully working part.
Read the book and follow along with the commit history.

## Status

> Currently working on a [self-host](https://github.com/prologic/monkey-lang/tree/self-host)
> branch where I'm improving and modifying the original Monkey-lang implementation
> to support writing Monkey in itself (*ala self-hosting*). So far I've managed to write a
> [Brainfuck](https://github.com/prologic/monkey-lang/blob/self-host/examples/bf.monkey)
> interpreter in Monkey with only a small number of improvements.

## Read and Follow

> Read the books and follow along with the following commit history.
(*This also happens to be the elapsed days I took to read both books!*)

See: [Reading Guide](./ReadingGuide.md)

> Please note that whilst reading the awesome books I slihtly modified this
> version of Monkey-lang in some places. FOr example I opted to have a single
> `RETURN` Opcode.

## Usage

To build run `make`.

```#!bash
$ go get -u github.com/prologic/monkey-lang
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/prologic/monkey-lang
$ make
This is the Monkey programming language!
Feel free to type in commands
>> 
```

To run the tests run `make test`

You can also execute program files by invoking `monkey-lang <filename>`
There are also some command-line options:

```#!bash
$ ./monkey-lang -h
Usage: monkey-lang [options] [<filename>]  -d	enable debug mode
  -i	enable interactive mode
  -v	display version information
  ```

## Monkey Language

> See also: [examples](./examples)

### Variable bindings and arithmetic expressions

```sh
>> a := 10;
>> b := a * 2;
>> (a + b) / 2 - 3;
12
>> c := 2.5;
>> b + c
22.5
```

### If expressions

```sh
>> a := 10;
>> b := a * 2;
>> c := if (b > a) { 99 } else { 100 };
>> c
99
```

### Functions and closures

```sh
>> multiply := fn(x, y) { x * y };
>> multiply(50 / 2, 1 * 2)
50
>> fn(x) { x + 10 }(10)
20
>> newAdder := fn(x) { fn(y) { x + y }; };
>> addTwo := newAdder(2);
>> addTwo(3);
5
>> sub := fn(a, b) { a - b };
>> applyFunc := fn(a, b, func) { func(a, b) };
>> applyFunc(10, 2, sub);
8
```

### Strings

```sh
>> makeGreeter := fn(greeting) { fn(name) { greeting + " " + name + "!" } };
>> hello := makeGreeter("Hello");
>> hello("skatsuta");
Hello skatsuta!
```

### Arrays

```sh
>> myArray := ["Thorsten", "Ball", 28, fn(x) { x * x }];
>> myArray[0]
Thorsten
>> myArray[4 - 2]
28
>> myArray[3](2);
4
```

### Hashes

```sh
>> myHash := {"name": "Jimmy", "age": 72, true: "yes, a boolean", 99: "correct, an integer"};
>> myHash["name"]
Jimmy
>> myHash["age"]
72
>> myHash[true]
yes, a boolean
>> myHash[99]
correct, an integer
```

### Builtin functions

```sh
>> len("hello");
5
>> len("âˆ‘");
1
>> myArray := ["one", "two", "three"];
>> len(myArray)
3
>> first(myArray)
one
>> rest(myArray)
[two, three]
>> last(myArray)
three
>> push(myArray, "four")
[one, two, three, four]
>> puts("Hello World")
Hello World
nil
```
